        <p align="left">In the past years, Green Earth Alliance has made tremendous progress in advancing its mission in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, we have been successful in planting over 350,000 indigenous trees, restoring degraded land and biodiversity. Our climate awareness campaigns have reached 180 schools, empowering both students and educators to take action against climate change. We have also enabled 75 green startups with seed funding and mentorship, giving young minds the ability to create sustainable businesses. Our partner communities have already seen a 20 percent reduction in plastic waste, driven by clean-up initiatives and neighborhood recycling initiatives.</p>
        <p align="left">In the years to come, we will continue to push towards our long-term objectives. By 2030, we will further expand our initiative to plant 1 million indigenous trees, giving future generations healthier ecosystems. Over the next five years, we are bringing climate education to 500 schools, enabling more youth with the knowledge and expertise needed for a sustainable future. By 2028, we will enable 200 green startups, creating jobs and green economy innovation. And finally, we are reducing plastic waste by 50 percent by 2027, working hand-in-hand with communities towards creating cleaner, safer, and more sustainable spaces.</p>

            To achieve this, Green Earth Alliance will expand its reforestation initiatives through partnerships with local communities, schools, and conservation groups across sub-Saharan Africa. 
            Our approach will be on degraded lands and biodiversity hotspots such that trees planted not only live but also contribute to the regeneration of ecosystems. 
            We will empower communities on tree care and maintenance and work with governments and private firms to secure land and material for large-scale reforestation.

            Over the next five years, we will scale our climate education program to reach 500 schools through curricular specific learning materials, workshops, and activity-based awareness campaigns. 
            Teachers and students will acquire hands-on expertise in climate change, sustainability, and conservation. With club activities, projects, and community service, we will see schools become nodes of environmental awareness and create community involvement on a larger scale.
        </p>

        <p align="center">
            In order to empower the young innovators, we will expand our incubation and mentorship to green start-ups in sectors of sustainable solutions such as renewable energy, recycling, green products, and climate-smart agriculture. 
            By provision of access to seed capital, capacity building, and business networking, Green Earth Alliance will empower entrepreneurs to develop sustainable businesses that create employment and address the most challenging environmental challenges. 
            Partnerships with governments and investors will also further spur the success potential of these start-ups.

            To cut plastic waste in half, implement community-led clean-up initiatives, expand recycling initiatives, and introduce innovative waste management technologies. 
            School awareness campaigns will foster the minimization of single-use plastics, and partnerships with local businesses will promote alternatives and responsible production. 
            By empowering communities with equipment, infrastructure, and capacity, we will achieve sustainable transformation that results in cleaner communities and healthier ecosystems.
