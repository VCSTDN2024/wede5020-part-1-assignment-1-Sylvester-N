            <h2>Green Earth Alliance History</h2>
            <p>Green Earth Alliance was founded in 2009 by a joint force of environmental scientists, community activists, and educators passionate about combating climate change and preserving biodiversity. Initially launched in Cape Town, South Africa, GEA began as a small grassroots organization focused on local tree-planting campaigns and educational programs. Over the years, it expanded its reach across Africa and partnered with international organizations to address global environmental issues. Today, it supports over 150 community-based sustainability projects and engages with thousands of volunteers annually.</p>

At the heart of its mission, Green Earth Alliance strives to educate and empower communities with sustainable practices that reduce environmental harm and encourage long-term stewardship.
